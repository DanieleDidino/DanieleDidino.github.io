I am a Data Scientist with a Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences, proficient in **Python**, **R**, and **SQL**, and have over 
**10 years of experience** in data analysis and machine learning. I specialize in analyzing and interpreting structured and unstructured data to generate reliable predictions and insights.

My background in quantitative analysis, cognitive science, and psychology brings a unique perspective to data science. I have a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms and a strong drive to apply cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems. I excel in designing and leading research projects from start to finish.

My passion for data analysis is evident through my ongoing collaboration with research groups studying the development of children with and without learning difficulties. For these groups, I preprocess and analyze data, define statistical approaches, develop models, test hypotheses, interpret results, and explain findings in clear terms.

I have collaborated with diverse, cross-functional teams, enhancing my communication skills and my ability to explain technical topics to general audiences. My research and mentoring experience equips me to effectively guide colleagues through complex data analysis and results.

My commitment to continuous learning and my technical and interpersonal skills enable me to deliver comprehensive data science solutions. Explore my [portfolio](/_data_proj/) of data projects from my education, personal ventures, and work at Dailogy. *More updates are coming soon!*
