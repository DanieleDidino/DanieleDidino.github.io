Dive into an interactive Tableau Dashboard to explore comprehensive pricing information and more across nine major European cities: Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Budapest, Lisbon, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. This dashboard allows you to analyze and compare key metrics including:

- **Average Price**: Understand how prices vary by city, room type, day of the week, and host status.
- **Cleanliness Rating**: Gauge the cleanliness of properties (scale of 1-10, with 10 being the best).
- **Guest Satisfaction**: Explore overall guest satisfaction (scale of 1-100, with 100 being the highest).
- **Proximity Indices**: Examine properties' proximity to tourist attractions and restaurants, each normalized on a scale of 1-100, with higher scores indicating closer proximity.
- **Distance Metrics**: View average distances to city centers and the nearest metro stations in kilometers.

Additionally, the dashboard offers insights into price distributions per city and customizable filters such as *Room Type*, *Guest Satisfaction*, *Cleanliness*, *Day of the Week*, and whether the host is a *Superhost*.
