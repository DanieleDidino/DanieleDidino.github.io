Explore my interactive Tableau Dashboard that delves into the dynamic world of video game sales from 1980 to 2016. This comprehensive visualization breaks down the sales data by genre and market, including global, North America (USA, Canada), Europe, and Japan. Users can personalize the view by selecting specific year ranges to focus on trends that matter most.

The dashboard features four distinct graphs:

- **Bar Plot**: Analyzes sales across different game genres.
- **Heat Map**: Displays sales data by genre and console developer (e.g., Nintendo, Sony, etc.).
- **Sales Over Time**: A line plot showing the trajectory of sales from 1980 to 2016.
- **Treemap**: Visualizes sales distribution by console developer and genre, highlighting market leaders and trends.

This dashboard offers insights into the shifts and trends in the video game industry.
